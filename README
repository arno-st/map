----[ Purpose

	This plugin Display all device in a Google map.

----[ Installation

	It use the site table from cacti.
	If your table is empty, it will be 'geocoded' from the device.
	In this case each device need to have the following snmp setting:
	snmp-server location Country;City;Street_Building;Floor;Room;Rack;RU;Lat;Long
	
	Lat; long is used if you don't have the street correct, like an equipment in middle of nowhere. but you still need to have all the filed, at least the ;
	
	On the Cacti Configuration page, under misc, you have a few line:
	choose if you want to use google map or openstreet map.
	if google map is coosen, you have to install the key
	then you have to enter the center location of the map with a field with this format:
	Country;City;Street_Building
	
	To create your site database, you can go under utilities -> System utilities and then 'Rebuild sites table'
	It will parse every device on your DB and look for snmp location information, then go to either googlemap or openstreet map to have all information to create the site table
	
	When you click on the tab MAP, it's can look empty depending of the browser, just click refresh, and you should see the map with the device on it.
	
	if not activate the debug and give me the output or any error message
