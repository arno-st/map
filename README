----[ Purpose

	This plugin is for scanning the network and follow the CDP discovered host, creating graph of all uplink.

----[ Installation

	To install the plugin, please refer to the Plugin Installation Documentation

	linkdiscovery requires the Settings plugin to be installed at least, but ideally thold and monitor too
    
----[ Possible Bugs?
   
    The way you can call thold from another plugin: it create a threshold based on all your template, as long as it fit your interface. Example: if you have a traffic threshold and a status threshold, both will be created !
	It's a simple way of doing it, and not very good. I'm planning to create better way, but that require to write directly into cacti database, without calling thold plugin
	
	On slow link it can crash you poller process, so I advice to disable slow link device
	If you find a problem, let me know!!! http://bugs.cacti.net
